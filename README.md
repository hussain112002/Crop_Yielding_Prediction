# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Yielding Prediction

A machine learning-based project that predicts the expected yield of crops using environmental and regional data such as temperature, rainfall, and soil characteristics. This tool assists farmers, researchers, and policymakers in making informed agricultural decisions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predict crop yield based on region-specific data
- Visualization of yield trends
- Uses regression models (Linear, Multiple, Random Forest, Neural Network, XGBoost)
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE

## ðŸ“Š Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
